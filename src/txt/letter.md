<t ms=48>00:00</t> foreign 28th of March 2018. deer Empress Hotel  <br>
<t ms=58>00:14</t> this may seem like an unusual request but I write to you today seeking an  <br>
<t ms=199>00:19</t> apology a pardon on my part  <br>
<t ms=52>00:23</t> 18 years ago a string of unfortunate events led to my being banned from your  <br>
<t ms=84>00:27</t> hotel I would like to explain the incident  <br>
<t ms=92>00:31</t> in 2001 I'd recently joined my current employer and I was also in the Canadian  <br>
<t ms=84>00:36</t> naval Reserve this new employer was hosting a customer conference at the  <br>
<t ms=86>00:40</t> empress and it was my first event with the company  <br>
<t ms=579>00:44</t> I told my Naval buddies that I was coming out west and I was asked to bring  <br>
<t ms=899>00:48</t> Brothers pepperoni from Halifax it's a local delicacy  <br>
<t ms=899>00:54</t> now because this was the Navy we were talking about I brought enough for a  <br>
<t ms=26>00:58</t> ship and in a hurry I completely filled an  <br>
<t ms=52>01:02</t> entire suitcase with pepperoni for my friends  <br>
<t ms=82>01:05</t> some of it was wrapped in plastic some in brown paper I took whatever brothers  <br>
<t ms=78>01:09</t> would sell me this is the bag that the airline  <br>
<t ms=58>01:14</t> misplaced now the bag reappeared the next day I  <br>
<t ms=979>01:19</t> knew the pepperoni would have still be good it had only been at room temp for a  <br>
<t ms=88>01:23</t> short time it would however be quite some time  <br>
<t ms=479>01:27</t> before I could turn it over to my friends so just to be safe I decided  <br>
<t ms=2>01:31</t> that I should keep it cool now my room was a nice big front-facing  <br>
<t ms=64>01:38</t> room on the fourth floor it was well appointed but it did not  <br>
<t ms=659>01:42</t> have a refrigerator it was April the air was chilly  <br>
<t ms=18>01:48</t> an easy way to keep all of this food cold would be just to keep it next to an  <br>
<t ms=38>01:52</t> open window so I lifted one of the sashes and spread the packages of  <br>
<t ms=5>01:55</t> pepperoni out on the table and windowsill  <br>
<t ms=22>01:59</t> and then I went for a walk for about four or five hours  <br>
<t ms=24>02:06</t> when I covered enough ground I returned to the hotel  <br>
<t ms=12>02:12</t> I remember walking down the Long Hall and opening the door to my room to find  <br>
<t ms=319>02:19</t> an entire Flock of Seagulls in my room I didn't have time to count but there  <br>
<t ms=36>02:27</t> must have been at least 40. and they'd been in my room  <br>
<t ms=239>02:33</t> eating pepperoni for a long time in case you're wondering Brothers TNT  <br>
<t ms=739>02:43</t> pepperoni does nasty things to see God's digestive system  <br>
<t ms=239>02:51</t> as you'd expect the room was covered in seagull crap what I did not realize  <br>
<t ms=739>02:55</t> until then was that seagulls also drool especially when they eat pepperoni  <br>
<t ms=5>03:04</t> I'm sure you have an image in your head now remember that I've just walked into  <br>
<t ms=92>03:07</t> the room and startled all of these birds they immediately started flying around  <br>
<t ms=68>03:13</t> and crashing into things and as desperately this they could try to leave  <br>
<t ms=34>03:17</t> the room through the small opening by which they had entered  <br>
<t ms=201>03:21</t> less composed seagulls were attempting to leave through the other closed  <br>
<t ms=2>03:25</t> windows and the result was a tornado of seagull  <br>
<t ms=64>03:29</t> excrement feathers pepperoni chunks and fairly large birds whipping around the  <br>
<t ms=14>03:34</t> room the lamps were falling the curtains were trashed the coffee table was just  <br>
<t ms=319>03:40</t> disgusting I waded through the birds and opened the  <br>
<t ms=319>03:46</t> remaining Windows most of the gulls left immediately one tried to re-enter the  <br>
<t ms=58>03:50</t> room to grab another piece of pepperoni and in my agitated State I took up one  <br>
<t ms=48>03:54</t> of my shoes and threw it at him both the gull and the shoe went out the  <br>
<t ms=28>03:59</t> window by this time I was down to one Gull  <br>
<t ms=92>04:04</t> but it was a big one and it didn't want to leave  <br>
<t ms=22>04:11</t> as I chased it it ran around the room with a big hunk of pepperoni in its gob  <br>
<t ms=82>04:17</t> and the Moment of clarity I grabbed the bath towel and jumped it  <br>
<t ms=959>04:21</t> it started to freak out so I wrapped it in the towel and threw it out of the  <br>
<t ms=5>04:25</t> window I had forgotten that seagulls cannot fly  <br>
<t ms=08>04:31</t> when wrapped in a bath towel now this is all happening fairly quickly  <br>
<t ms=96>04:36</t> and this is mid-afternoon the Empress Hotel hosts a very famous  <br>
<t ms=78>04:42</t> and very popular high tea I suspect this is where the large group  <br>
<t ms=22>04:50</t> of tourists was heading when they were struck first by my shoe  <br>
<t ms=04>04:56</t> then a bound up seagull the seagull was unharmed by the way  <br>
<t ms=94>05:05</t> let's go back to my little housekeeping issue  <br>
<t ms=12>05:09</t> the room was bad there was lots of damage  <br>
<t ms=66>05:15</t> I was new to my company and I was really trying to make a good impression that  <br>
<t ms=259>05:19</t> this important event so I decided that I would carry on for now and handle this  <br>
<t ms=68>05:22</t> whole thing later I then realized that I had only a few minutes before an  <br>
<t ms=58>05:26</t> important dinner and I had only one shoe I made my way to one of the side doors  <br>
<t ms=639>05:32</t> and recovered both shoe and towel that were laying in some wet soil near the  <br>
<t ms=78>05:36</t> walking path the shoe was a mess I took it back to the room by this time I had  <br>
<t ms=12>05:42</t> closed the windows and the air was becoming quite ripe with the smell of  <br>
<t ms=78>05:45</t> digested pepperoni and fish I went into the washroom and rinsed the  <br>
<t ms=32>05:52</t> mud off my shoe it cleaned up nicely but now I had one wet dark shoe  <br>
<t ms=139>05:58</t> and one dry light color too in retrospect I should have just wet the  <br>
<t ms=86>06:04</t> dry shoe but instead I chose to dry the wet shoe  <br>
<t ms=58>06:08</t> using the little hair dryer it was actually doing quite well I had  <br>
<t ms=3>06:12</t> the hair dryer jammed in there and the shoe was drying quite nicely then the  <br>
<t ms=259>06:16</t> phone rang I walked into the next room to answer it  <br>
<t ms=86>06:19</t> and the power goes off it turns out that the hair dryer had  <br>
<t ms=84>06:24</t> vibrated free of the shoe and fallen into the sink full of water  <br>
<t ms=84>06:30</t> I don't know how much of the hotel's power I knocked out but at that point  <br>
<t ms=74>06:34</t> I decided I needed help I called the front desk and asked for  <br>
<t ms=62>06:40</t> someone to come help me clean up a mess still remember the look on the lady's  <br>
<t ms=28>06:47</t> face and she opened the door and  <br>
<t ms=5>06:52</t> I have absolutely no idea what to tell her so I said  <br>
<t ms=419>06:57</t> I'm sorry and I went to dinner  <br>
<t ms=94>07:05</t> when I came back my things had been moved to a much smaller room  <br>
<t ms=78>07:12</t> I thought that was the end of it all until I was told that my company had  <br>
<t ms=02>07:16</t> received a letter Banning me from the empress a band that I have respected for  <br>
<t ms=06>07:21</t> almost 18 years now I have matured  <br>
<t ms=58>07:26</t> and I admit responsibility for my actions I come to you hat in hand to  <br>
<t ms=38>07:31</t> apologize for the damage I had indirectly come to cause and to ask you  <br>
<t ms=88>07:35</t> to reconsider my lifetime ban from the property I hope that you will see fit to  <br>
<t ms=5>07:40</t> either grant me a pardon or consider my 18 years away from the empress's time  <br>
<t ms=84>07:45</t> served thank you very much for your consideration sincerely Nick Burchell  <br>
<t ms=18>07:51</t> all right<br>
