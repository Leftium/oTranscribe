<t ms=049>00:06</t> My mommy is that big lady over there? Susan's blood froze as she realized her five  <br>
year old son up on stage speaking through  

<t ms=699>00:14</t> a microphone in front of 300 people was pointing  <br>
right at her. That big lady over there.  

<t ms=339>00:22</t> As dozens of men and women turn their heads  <br>
towards her. She prayed for the ground to swallow her uphold.  

<t ms=39>00:29</t> Never had she felt so embarrassed. Never had she been so ashamed about her weight.  <br>
<t ms=23>00:35</t> Never had she felt so weak for letting herself  <br>
go. It was school sports day, and she was so proud  
of her five year old for winning his race.  

<t ms=19>00:44</t> Her heart swelled with joy at seeing him collect  <br>
his little trophy on stage. And now in front of 300 people like any innocent  
young kid would he spoke the honest truth  

<t ms=98>00:55</t> when the principal asked who his mommy was  <br>
that big lady over there. This was how he saw his mom.  

<t ms=6>01:03</t> It was the most humiliating moments of her  <br>
life. All those parents and teachers from school  
would know her as that big lady.  

<t ms=77>01:11</t> They go home and talk about her, maybe laugh  <br>
at her. Sure she knew she'd put on a few pounds.  

<t ms=14>01:17</t> But when did it get so out of control. That's when Susan's heart suddenly started  <br>
pounding like a rock hammer.  

<t ms=1>01:25</t> She keeled over gasping for breath, pain crushing  <br>
her chest, then Moments later, she knew it was too late.  

<t ms=24>01:33</t> What happened next is shocking and painful  <br>
for me to tell. But what we didn't know at the time was that  
this event would lead to the discovery of  

<t ms=78>01:41</t> a mysterious weight loss solution, a breakthrough  <br>
which caused Susan Attlee, a 45 year old dental assistant from near St. Louis, Missouri to  
suddenly lose 33 pounds of fat and amaze her  

<t ms=76>01:54</t> friends and family with their mind blowing  <br>
transformation. And she would then go on to drop another 21  
pounds in the weeks that followed, going from  

<t ms=56>02:03</t> this to this without exercise without even  <br>
dieting. She supported healthy blood pressure, blood  
sugar and cholesterol levels, she was able  

<t ms=46>02:14</t> to wear her favorite clothes again. She started looking 10 years younger, and  <br>
a few short weeks later, Susan woke up oozing  

<t ms=23>02:23</t> a new self confidence and happiness she hadn't  <br>
felt since her 20s friends and family members were stunned by her new slim and toned body.  

<t ms=84>02:32</t> Susan didn't use any of the methods that are  <br>
so heavily promoted by the weight loss industry. The powerful fat burning solution that she  
stumbled on is not a diet is not a workout  

<t ms=75>02:44</t> is not a fat burning pill is not some weight  <br>
loss gadget. It's like nothing you've ever seen before.  

<t ms=62>02:52</t> The truth is you don't know about this simple  <br>
natural solution because it's been hidden from the public since it was discovered.  

<t ms=82>03:00</t> It will shock you to discover the ingredients  <br>
in the formula that melted away her excess body fat so fast, a solution that came from  
the most unexpected source, a 3000 year old  

<t ms=68>03:13</t> unusual tonic that dates right back to the  <br>
time of the ancient native tribes of Japan. This tonic comes from an island where overweight  
men and women are unheard of and where people  

<t ms=319>03:25</t> have the longest life expectancy in the world. You take this tonic for its astonishing fat  <br>
burning benefits, as well as for the immense  

<t ms=069>03:34</t> energy punch it delivers. Why is it so powerful?  <br>
<t ms=77>03:37</t> Simple. It targets the root cause of belly fat, a  <br>
tiny protein in your blood that blocks your  

<t ms=04>03:44</t> metabolism and causes inflamed digestion,  <br>
devastating brain fog and crushing fatigue and it increases each year you age meaning  
if you don't target it now, it'll only get  

<t ms=12>03:56</t> worse. When you target this protein with a small  <br>
cup of a powerful tonic I'm going to reveal  

<t ms=01>04:02</t> to you in a few minutes, you'll activate your  <br>
master fat burning hormone which converts the food you eat to energy instead of storing  
it as fat cells.  

<t ms=93>04:12</t> This is what Courtney from Pennsylvania did. She got rid of the fat on her back lower belly  <br>
and arms using this formula.  

<t ms=709>04:20</t> She feels so happy she can fit into her clothes  <br>
from 10 years ago and she has twice the energy she did before.  

<t ms=529>04:28</t> I don't feel hungry for carbs anymore like  <br>
I used to every afternoon. I feel full of energy when I wake up in the  
morning.  

<t ms=81>04:35</t> Just being able to wear my favorite jeans  <br>
again after so many years feels wonderful. And take a look at john from New Jersey.  

<t ms=99>04:43</t> He used this science based breakthrough to  <br>
support healthy blood sugar and blood pressure and he melted away 36 pounds from around his  
belly neck and love handle areas.  

<t ms=9>04:54</t> His doctor was in shock about how he did it  <br>
so fast. I got to the point where I knew I had to do  
something about it fast, you know, my weight  

<t ms=961>05:03</t> was getting out of control and I couldn't  <br>
even walk up the stairs without getting out of breath.  

<t ms=83>05:08</t> I was also worried about my heart and my blood  <br>
sugar levels, and my doctor had given me enough warnings.  

<t ms=479>05:15</t> When I started taking this new tonic formula  <br>
in the mornings, I noticed the changes started happening after like three days.  

<t ms=889>05:21</t> My junk food cravings went away like that. I had lots of new energy, and the weight just  <br>
started dropping off me real fast.  

<t ms=319>05:30</t> And here's Rena from Texas. She wanted to lose as much belly fat as possible  <br>
for a family reunion, but she couldn't exercise  

<t ms=809>05:37</t> because of whiplash in her neck. Here's what happened after following this  <br>
protocol.  

<t ms=009>05:43</t> And here's what Rena wrote to me. Dear Mike, I'm very grateful that I stumbled  <br>
upon your video, my life has been transformed  

<t ms=63>05:50</t> since I lost 38 pounds. It feels great to look in the mirror these  <br>
days lol I was skeptical about it working  

<t ms=86>05:57</t> at first, but thank God I tried. The part that worked best was when you show  <br>
the easy 32nd formula at the end of your video.  

<t ms=93>06:05</t> Thank you so much. When you drink this tonic once a day before  <br>
10am.  

<t ms=83>06:11</t> You burn fat cells every night, resulting  <br>
in breathtaking weight loss of up to a pound of fat a day, your food is transformed into  
energy that surges through every cell in your  

<t ms=559>06:22</t> body, you become as sharp as a razor blade. As your brain lights up.  <br>
<t ms=68>06:27</t> You feel confident, strong and as young as  <br>
you did 10 years ago. Those are just some of the benefits.  

<t ms=939>06:34</t> And I know you may feel a little skeptical  <br>
when I tell you that drinking a simple daily tonic while following a few nutritional tips  
can do all this for you.  

<t ms=71>06:43</t> I felt that way too. But stick with me for a minute.  <br>
<t ms=509>06:47</t> And I'll show you the science behind this  <br>
breakthrough formula that is unlike anything else.  

<t ms=349>06:53</t> It comes from overseas and a brilliant doctor  <br>
revealed it to me. So if you've been struggling with your weight,  
don't be hard on yourself.  

<t ms=66>07:01</t> It's not your fault. Nobody ever told you about this hidden cause  <br>
of weight gain.  

<t ms=259>07:07</t> You can be 100% sure you've never heard about  <br>
it before. And make sure you pay close attention because  
in a couple of minutes, I will also reveal  

<t ms=319>07:16</t> leaked insider information that blows wide  <br>
open the deceptive methods of the weight loss industry.  

<t ms=779>07:22</t> The one food most people believe to be healthy  <br>
that clogs your arteries and causes dangerous cravings.  

<t ms=169>07:29</t> And best of all, the little known red Japanese  <br>
flower that triggers your master fat burning hormone and melts off fat like butter in a  
frying pan.  

<t ms=629>07:38</t> Now look, before we get to that you should  <br>
know that I'm going to upset some people with what I'll reveal to you in a minute.  

<t ms=719>07:45</t> Some greedy executives in the weight loss  <br>
industry are already furious with what I'm about to tell you and are arming their lawyers  
right now.  

<t ms=78>07:53</t> So make sure to listen to every word I say  <br>
until the end of this video and pay close attention.  

<t ms=58>08:00</t> This is critical information for anybody suffering  <br>
from belly fat quite simply, you cannot afford to miss this before I share this incredible  
tonic with you.  

<t ms=889>08:10</t> I should tell you about myself. My name is Mike banner.  <br>
<t ms=619>08:14</t> I'm a firefighter from Gainesville, Florida,  <br>
and I'm also Susan's brother. I've always looked out for my kids sister.  

<t ms=219>08:22</t> We've been pretty close over the years. Her dream was to get married, have a beautiful  <br>
family and live happily ever after she met  

<t ms=529>08:29</t> her husband mark and they had kids but after  <br>
that it didn't quite go as planned. See after her second child Jordan was born  
Susan gained 40 pounds that she found impossible  

<t ms=539>08:40</t> to lose no matter what she did. It made her life a misery especially as her  <br>
old diet tricks didn't work anymore.  

<t ms=09>08:48</t> In her 20s Susan could skip carbs a few days  <br>
a week and lose five pounds without breaking a sweat.  

<t ms=81>08:54</t> Now in her 40s nothing seemed to help Atkins  <br>
keto and paleo were all failing her. Even her exercise bike hardly made a difference.  

<t ms=49>09:04</t> As soon as he stopped working out the pounds  <br>
came piling back on her favorite clothes didn't fit anymore.  

<t ms=88>09:11</t> She'd see other women who'd be toned and skinny  <br>
no matter what they ate. Why couldn't she be like them?  

<t ms=959>09:17</t> Was it her genetics? Was he doing something wrong? she felt like  <br>
she had no control.  

<t ms=74>09:23</t> And she couldn't help thinking was she doomed  <br>
to stay like this forever. Susan started eating out of comfort to make  
herself feel better.  

<t ms=16>09:32</t> And even though she avoided looking in the  <br>
mirror and weighing herself she could feel she was getting bigger and heavier.  

<t ms=029>09:39</t> People would look at her differently sometimes  <br>
with pity in their eyes. As her weight ballooned, her back started  
hurting and she felt tired all the time.  

<t ms=329>09:48</t> The doctor warned her several times about  <br>
her blood sugar levels. It put pressure on her marriage with her husband  
mark.  

<t ms=319>09:55</t> He only wanted the best for his wife but it  <br>
seemed nothing could cheer her up and it All came to a head that beautiful sunny sports  
day at her son Jordan's elementary school.  

<t ms=31>10:06</t> The pride of seeing her young son when his  <br>
race made her feel the happiest she had in years.  

<t ms=73>10:12</t> She was beaming at everyone she saw. Her heart was jumping for joy as he stepped  <br>
up on stage to be awarded his trophy.  

<t ms=889>10:20</t> Yet only minutes later, Susan shrunk in shame  <br>
when young Jordan announced to all 300 people watching that his mom was that big lady over  
there.  

<t ms=019>10:32</t> Never had she felt more humiliated in all  <br>
her life. And that's when her heart pounding like a  
rock hammer, Susan blacked out.  

<t ms=899>10:40</t> She was rushed to the hospital immediately. We prayed for her life that night, young Jordan  <br>
prayed to God for a miracle.  

<t ms=08>10:49</t> He just wanted to wake up the next day, see  <br>
his mommy and give her a big hug. Please don't die, mommy.  

<t ms=77>10:56</t> He prayed. It's too early for you to go.  <br>
<t ms=019>11:00</t> And maybe God heard Jordan's touching prayers,  <br>
because Susan made an amazing recovery that night.  

<t ms=7>11:07</t> And not only that, you'll be stunned to hear  <br>
about her weight loss breakthrough that took place soon after.  

<t ms=959>11:13</t> I'll tell you about it in just a minute. Before I do, there's something super important  <br>
you should know.  

<t ms=339>11:20</t> And it's that the fat on Susan's body was  <br>
choking the life out of her heart. Susan had an appointment with Dr. Tamaki a  
cardiologist from Japan soon after her collapse.  

<t ms=98>11:31</t> He was in the US for three month placement  <br>
nearing the end of his stay. He told Susan that her extra weight, especially  
around the belly meant that she was at permanent  

<t ms=98>11:41</t> severe risk of a heart attack or stroke that  <br>
could strike without warning at any minute. She had to lose at least 30 pounds to reduce  
this risk.  

<t ms=57>11:52</t> And what he said next changed our lives forever. He told us the root cause of her lethal deep  <br>
fat was a little known inflammatory protein  

<t ms=769>12:02</t> that millions of men and women are unaware  <br>
of. Dr. Tamaki told Susan that this inflammatory  
protein was originally only seen in people  

<t ms=89>12:11</t> who had been exposed to smoke inhalation,  <br>
but now it was present in almost every overweight man and woman's blood.  

<t ms=54>12:19</t> This protein makes it impossible to lose belly  <br>
fat because it blocks your master fat burning hormone adiponectin.  

<t ms=899>12:27</t> And what's more, he said you'll be at high  <br>
risk of several deadly diseases, diseases that are on the increase and are causing millions  
of good men and women to drop dead like flies.  

<t ms=06>12:39</t> The scientific name for it is C reactive protein  <br>
or CRP. Dr. Tamaki told Susan that CRP damages your  
mitochondria, which means your body can't  

<t ms=56>12:50</t> break down your nutrients into energy. And not only does it stop you from getting  <br>
energy from food, but it traps your body in  

<t ms=95>12:57</t> survival mode. And when your body is stuck in survival mode,  <br>
it shuts down your master fat burning hormone  

<t ms=649>13:04</t> and forces you to cling on to fat cells making  <br>
it impossible for you to shed them. And this is why it's the leading cause of  
belly fat.  

<t ms=829>13:13</t> What's more, being just a few pounds overweight  <br>
increases your CRP levels even more, meaning it only gets worse and makes it practically  
impossible to drop a few pounds unless you  

<t ms=85>13:25</t> act immediately. High CRP levels are caused by foods that most  <br>
people believe to be healthy, as well as hidden  

<t ms=11>13:33</t> toxins and veggies and water. And there's no medical treatment for it that  <br>
doesn't have her rific side effects.  

<t ms=399>13:40</t> But the good news is that when you take this  <br>
potent tonic daily before 10am you can switch off CRP almost immediately.  

<t ms=12>13:49</t> When you do that, you'll activate your most  <br>
powerful fat burning hormone adiponectin cut up to a pound of deep belly fat each day and  
you'll instantly enhance your health and energy  

<t ms=949>13:59</t> levels. Susan was a little surprised and skeptical  <br>
when she heard this even though it was coming  

<t ms=749>14:05</t> from a highly qualified doctor. She didn't know her belly fat was so deadly.  <br>
<t ms=339>14:11</t> She'd never heard of this lethal cause of  <br>
weight gain. Why didn't doctors from the US ever talk about  
it? she asked.  

<t ms=1>14:18</t> Dr. Tamaki smiled and replied that Western  <br>
doctors knew all about C reactive protein and how it was the hidden cause of the weight  
gain epidemic sweeping America but they were  

<t ms=259>14:29</t> trained to provide drugs to manage symptoms  <br>
and not to target the causes. This is why the weight loss and pharma industries  
are worth billions of dollars in Okinawa,  

<t ms=29>14:40</t> an island of Japan It was quite standard for  <br>
doctors to target this cause of belly fat using a special blend of antioxidant herbs  
and foods to resolve a laundry list of health  

<t ms=54>14:50</t> conditions. And that is why Okinawa has the lowest obesity  <br>
levels in the world the best brain health  

<t ms=519>14:57</t> almost no cases of diabetes type too and the  <br>
longest life expectancy on the planet in Okinawa, two out of three people live to the age of  
97.  

<t ms=63>15:09</t> Susan didn't know that she could target belly  <br>
fat with anything except the diet and exercise methods she'd always struggled with.  

<t ms=089>15:17</t> Due to her knee pain. She had been skeptical but now she started  <br>
to think it all made sense.  

<t ms=42>15:24</t> Nothing she tried had ever made the slightest  <br>
difference, no diet, no workout plan, and no supplements.  

<t ms=209>15:32</t> Susan had tried Nutrisystem Weight Watchers  <br>
Jenny Craig keto and paleo diets. She and Mark had both tried the insanity and  
p90x workouts but gave up after two weeks  

<t ms=279>15:44</t> because of the sharp pains and their knees. Dr. Tamaki said that when she did target CRP,  <br>
she could go ahead and eat her favorite foods  

<t ms=61>15:52</t> such as pizza and chocolate desserts and still  <br>
melt the excess fat from her belly buns and hips at an astonishing rate.  

<t ms=79>16:00</t> This is because when you target CRP you activate  <br>
your most important fat burning hormone adiponectin adiponectin breaks down fat cells at a rapid  
rate and supports healthy blood glucose levels.  

<t ms=12>16:14</t> When it's at optimal levels, weight loss becomes  <br>
much easier. Susan wasn't sure because she'd always believed  
you needed to go on a diet and restrict calories  

<t ms=309>16:23</t> to lose weight. Dr. Tamaki kindly told her that no diet or  <br>
exercise plan in the world would help her  

<t ms=829>16:29</t> lose a single pound of fat if she had high  <br>
levels of CRP. But what he said next made Susan very curious.  

<t ms=87>16:38</t> He told her there was a unique blend of foods  <br>
and herbs that incinerates belly fat. in Okinawa, Japan, doctors recommend a special formula  
of foods and herbs that instantly activate  

<t ms=949>16:51</t> dormant fat burning hormones. When you do the same, you'll burn fat cells  <br>
very fast without exercise.  

<t ms=49>16:59</t> No matter your age. You could lose two pounds the first day with  <br>
this Okinawa formula.  

<t ms=18>17:05</t> He said Japanese doctors and dieticians would  <br>
ask their patients to take this formula once a day before 10am and it had an incredible  
success rate.  

<t ms=08>17:16</t> patients of all ages from 18 to 80 years old  <br>
would melt away belly fat in a few weeks. What's more, they maintain healthy blood sugar  
levels, cholesterol and blood vessels too.  

<t ms=1048>17:28</t> And that's not all because 95% of these patients  <br>
supported healthy brain and memory performance and super high energy levels as they aged.  

<t ms=76>17:36</t> Remember, this tiny protein in your blood  <br>
is the root cause of runaway belly fat, inflamed digestion and draining fatigue.  

<t ms=75>17:45</t> Once you target it, you can melt that at an  <br>
astonishing rate by jumpstarting your main fat burning hormone adiponectin.  

<t ms=85>17:53</t> adiponectin is a bit like an internal traffic  <br>
cop for your fat cells. When it's switched on.  

<t ms=32>17:59</t> It tells your body to use fat as energy instead  <br>
of storing it around your waist back buns and thighs when it's switched off.  

<t ms=46>18:07</t> It's like the traffic cops are off duty. Your fat cells are stuck in gridlock and gets  <br>
stored in your problem areas.  

<t ms=02>18:15</t> Susan wanted to know if there was a new medical  <br>
treatment that could help her doctor Tamaki shook his head.  

<t ms=53>18:20</t> No medical treatment will help without giving  <br>
you severe side effects such as mental confusion and liver damage, he said, but there is something  
else you can try.  

<t ms=94>18:30</t> Before he could go any further. Another doctor arrived to call Dr. Tamaki  <br>
away to see another patient urgently.  

<t ms=43>18:38</t> But as he left the hospital room, he suddenly  <br>
turned around and scribbled something on a scrap of paper.  

<t ms=21>18:44</t> He said to Susan, you nearly lost your family  <br>
and your life when you ended up here in the hospital.  

<t ms=27>18:50</t> And one thing you must know is that you don't  <br>
deserve it. It's not your fault.  

<t ms=32>18:56</t> handing the scrap of paper to them. He said, I have to return to my country soon.  <br>
<t ms=05>19:01</t> If you don't see me again, send an email to  <br>
this address. When Susan and Mark left the hospital they  
felt better because they finally understood  

<t ms=52>19:09</t> the causes of these dangerous health issues  <br>
that had been destroying their lives for years. The belly fat, the joint discomfort, the low  
energy, why nothing they ever tried helped  

<t ms=81>19:20</t> keep the weight off why their marriage was  <br>
suffering so much. All they had to do was use dr to Maki's formula,  
and they could lose as much weight as they  

<t ms=51>19:30</t> wanted. You can lose one pound a day Dr. Tamaki had  <br>
said something very important that you should  

<t ms=07>19:37</t> know is that Susan didn't know about the deadly  <br>
risks of belly fat. That's why I'm telling you this now, because  
you may have these symptoms without being  

<t ms=63>19:46</t> aware of it either. You may have deep visceral fat that chokes  <br>
the life out of your internal organs, which  

<t ms=39>19:53</t> is why it's critical that you do what I say  <br>
in this video. With what I'm about to show you you'll turn  
Get the single root cause of deep fat in 24  

<t ms=96>20:03</t> hours. When you do that your fat will fall off your  <br>
body with almost no effort.  

<t ms=49>20:09</t> You may be thinking you've seen it all before  <br>
when it comes to weight loss, but I promise you, you've never seen this in your life.  

<t ms=98>20:17</t> See, this fat melting solution I'm about to  <br>
show you is nothing like your typical intense workout or detox diet.  

<t ms=12>20:26</t> It's something completely different. And you can be sure you've never seen it before.  <br>
<t ms=64>20:31</t> It's not available in stores or online anywhere. But if you do what I say in a minute, you  <br>
can do it yourself from home, make sure you  

<t ms=56>20:39</t> listen to what I'm about to tell you. Because the truth of the matter is, the weight  <br>
loss industry pumps out despicable lies to  

<t ms=2>20:47</t> mislead you to try to keep you overweight  <br>
and sick as long as possible. Susan and Mark both fell for these deceptive  
tricks.  

<t ms=69>20:55</t> It nearly ended their marriage as they grew  <br>
fatter, sicker, and lower in energy. They were weeks away from separation.  

<t ms=14>21:03</t> And yet following the weight loss industry's  <br>
advice was the root cause of the problem. Susan and Mark were shocked to learn that  
the health and diet foods they were eating,  

<t ms=04>21:13</t> we're actually increasing the build up. One example was the prepared weight loss shakes  <br>
they took that are marketed as a health food.  

<t ms=13>21:22</t> Some of these shakes contain dangerous trans  <br>
fats that clog your arteries and force you to store fat cells.  

<t ms=48>21:29</t> They also generate uncontrollable cravings. And that's why it's so important for you to  <br>
target your belly fat using this formula instead.  

<t ms=34>21:39</t> When you take the Okinawa flat belly tonic  <br>
before 10am. Once a day, your body will force fat cells  
to melt to release harmful toxins and shrink  

<t ms=47>21:48</t> your belly stick with me because I'm about  <br>
to share the fat melting formula with you to know how to use this formula.  

<t ms=58>21:56</t> You have to remember what Dr Tamaki said levels  <br>
of the C reactive protein shoot through the roof when you inflame your lungs from inhaling  
smoke.  

<t ms=63>22:05</t> The reason this is important is because a  <br>
couple of decades back when I was a young firefighter, I saw this very formula and action.  

<t ms=23>22:14</t> At the time. I used to work the pipes with Dempsey, a brave  <br>
but overweight rookie who I'd taken under  

<t ms=48>22:20</t> my wing as we tackle the blaze one night Dempsey  <br>
inhaled some toxic smoke and suffered from severe coughing fits and fatigue.  

<t ms=31>22:29</t> And one old timer firefighter Greg knew exactly  <br>
what to do. He told us dancies coughing was the type of  
dangerous smoke from an older building that  

<t ms=13>22:38</t> filtered through gas masks in flaming Dempsey's  <br>
lungs. It would take months or even years for him  
to recover if nothing was done about it fast.  

<t ms=49>22:47</t> Greg, who spent some of his childhood in Japan  <br>
brewed an unusual drink from a mix of berries and leaves for Dempsey.  

<t ms=57>22:54</t> We thought this was a strange old remedy at  <br>
the time, but it seemed to instantly fix the dangerous irritation inside Dempsey's body.  

<t ms=34>23:02</t> And what happened next was astonishing. Dempsey's belly fat that hung out over his  <br>
belt started to shrink.  

<t ms=67>23:09</t> After three or four days of drinking Greg's  <br>
strange drink, we could already see that Dempsey was losing weight fast, he'd always be tightening  
his belt.  

<t ms=35>23:18</t> It got to the point where his belly was shrinking  <br>
so fast, I wanted to take him to see a doctor about it.  

<t ms=34>23:25</t> Dempsey was a guy who couldn't even lose his  <br>
belly fat when he worked out every day, but only weeks later, Dempsey had suddenly become  
one of the leanest fittest guys in the fire  

<t ms=51>23:35</t> station. he'd lost 20 pounds of stubborn fat from his  <br>
belly and love handles.  

<t ms=57>23:40</t> At the time, we just thought he was doing  <br>
a starvation diet, but Dempsey later told me he was eating all his favorite foods such  
as fries, cheeseburgers and beer.  

<t ms=9>23:49</t> And it was the special drink that melted his  <br>
fat away so fast. When he took that drink every morning.  

<t ms=93>23:55</t> He felt great and was full of energy bright  <br>
eyed and ready for the job at any time. I remembered this entire incident after Susan  
came back from the hospital.  

<t ms=73>24:05</t> But I had no way of contacting Dempsey, the  <br>
clock was ticking. And I knew at that point, I had to do something.  

<t ms=76>24:13</t> There had to be a way to target this dangerous  <br>
blood protein or my sister could lose her life and young Jordan would lose his mommy,  
Dr. Tamaki had returned to Japan.  

<t ms=28>24:24</t> So I urgently sent an email to the address  <br>
that he gave to Susan earlier. I waited three days for a response, but none  
came.  

<t ms=59>24:32</t> So that weekend, I got to work like a man  <br>
possessed researching medical journals in a library nearby.  

<t ms=46>24:39</t> After a few hours, I finally stumbled on a  <br>
book and a couple of journals where I found out more about C reactive protein.  

<t ms=61>24:46</t> In one of the journals, scientists reviewed  <br>
seven different studies proving that C reactive protein was the single common factor in every  
overweight man or woman because it shuts down  

<t ms=33>24:57</t> adiponectin the most important weight loss  <br>
hormone. In another journal, I found out that CRP was  
present in almost every one of the deadly  

<t ms=25>25:06</t> health conditions that are killing millions  <br>
of people. But even if doctors and researchers knew this  
much, they never mentioned once how to target  

<t ms=86>25:14</t> this dangerous inflammatory blood protein. Instead, every single article on CRP and those  <br>
medical journals finished with a note about  

<t ms=42>25:23</t> how a big pharma company was working on a  <br>
new weight loss drug that looked promising, but was still at least a few years away.  

<t ms=94>25:30</t> And this made me mad. Dr. Tamaki had said that in Japan, they would  <br>
target CRP and jumpstart the master fat burning  

<t ms=56>25:38</t> hormone using a natural mix of foods, herbs  <br>
and spices, scientists could wipe out the single root cause of the weight gain epidemic  
and multiple deadly conditions in months if  

<t ms=12>25:49</t> they publish this information today, and no  <br>
medical journal wanted to talk about it. Then I remembered what Dr. Tamaki said, in  
western countries, the treatment focuses only  

<t ms=29>26:01</t> on drugs to manage symptoms once they're present. They never fixed the root cause.  <br>
<t ms=9>26:07</t> And after three full days and seven evenings  <br>
of research, I had gotten nowhere. What could I do about my sister?  

<t ms=4>26:15</t> How long would her body hold out? I still hadn't received a reply in three weeks  <br>
from the email I sent to Dr. Tamaki.  

<t ms=82>26:22</t> I knew that I could choose to get mad about  <br>
that too. But if there's one thing being a firefighter  
has taught me, it's you should never give  

<t ms=34>26:30</t> up. Always keep your head up.  <br>
<t ms=96>26:32</t> Stay positive. I went to my email inbox and was about to  <br>
look for Dr. Tamaki, his contact details when  

<t ms=07>26:39</t> I suddenly noticed a new message had arrived  <br>
from an anonymous email address, it had no subject line and inside the email message,  
it just said for review, I opened it and attached  

<t ms=94>26:50</t> to the email where a bunch of PDF documents,  <br>
maybe this was Dr. Timothy's way of getting back to me anonymously.  

<t ms=24>26:58</t> So I carefully opened the first PDF file. It seemed to be a scanned image of a medical  <br>
study.  

<t ms=25>27:04</t> The first thing I noticed was that it said  <br>
confidential not for release to public printed in red capital letters across it.  

<t ms=42>27:11</t> A secret medical study that wasn't for public  <br>
release. Did this mean that it held some key information  
that could hurt shady drug companies profits,  

<t ms=17>27:20</t> my heart beating faster, I quickly downloaded  <br>
all the attached PDFs from the anonymous email and printed them out.  

<t ms=18>27:27</t> All of the studies were related to C reactive  <br>
protein in the body and how scientists had done plenty of testing on it.  

<t ms=58>27:34</t> The purpose of their studies had been to find  <br>
a new drug to target excess body fat. The scientists wanted to develop a super pill  
that allowed people to eat as much as they  

<t ms=26>27:44</t> wanted of any kind of foods and stay slim. They'd studied the ancient diet of the natives  <br>
in Okinawa, where Dr. Tamaki came from, as  

<t ms=42>27:52</t> well as the diets of native tribes in Bolivia. In the experiments, scientists discovered  <br>
a super powerful food substance called anthocyanins  

<t ms=25>28:01</t> foods and drinks with high levels of anthocyanins  <br>
or red cabbage, green tea and spinach. One report explained exactly how to combine  
these powerful natural substances to destroy  

<t ms=46>28:11</t> belly fat. Scientists had tested 140 different combinations  <br>
of anthocyanins from different foods and had  

<t ms=47>28:18</t> come up with one potent combination that blew  <br>
away everything else in terms of results for weight loss.  

<t ms=94>28:24</t> This one mix of anthocyanins had an astonishing  <br>
effect on destroying fat cells. It also helped reduce symptoms of practically  
every major modern deadly condition in the  

<t ms=12>28:35</t> Western world. This potent natural mixture actually heated  <br>
up fat cells and caused them to be released  

<t ms=5>28:41</t> as pure energy. For the men and women in the study.  <br>
<t ms=71>28:44</t> It was as though they were doing an intense  <br>
workout when in reality, they could be lying on the couch watching TV, the pharma companies  
were going to base their new fat melting pill  

<t ms=15>28:54</t> on this natural anthocyanin formula and patented  <br>
to make billions of dollars. When I read this secret report, I felt dizzy  
and my heart started pounding in my chest.  

<t ms=36>29:05</t> I was nervous but very excited. I could finally save my sister's life with  <br>
a proven potent natural blend.  

<t ms=19>29:13</t> Here it was the solution was right in front  <br>
of me. All I had to do was mix the right foods, herbs  
and spices they listed in the study together  

<t ms=59>29:21</t> with some water and she would take it once  <br>
a day. I called Susan my hands shaking and told her  
what I'd found.  

<t ms=08>29:29</t> Susan's first reaction was excitement. Like me, she had an idea of what this mind  <br>
blowing breakthrough could do for her.  

<t ms=89>29:35</t> She imagined how her life would be transformed  <br>
with effortless weight loss. A flat toned belly waking up from the deepest  
and most reinvigorating sleep every morning  

<t ms=94>29:45</t> and being free of all pain in her back and  <br>
joints. she imagined the new burst of confidence. she imagined the feeling of pure happiness  
as she'd walked down the street on a beautiful  

<t ms=92>29:56</t> spring day, how she'd be able to wear her  <br>
favorite clothes. Again, how she could look great and feel sexy  
at the beach in her bikini and how she could  

<t ms=29>30:05</t> start swimming at the pool again, but Susan  <br>
had been let down many times before. And as a cautious person, she still felt skeptical  
and wondered if this would really work.  

<t ms=28>30:16</t> It all seems so simple and yet she believed  <br>
for years that losing fat was a complicated, tough process.  

<t ms=89>30:22</t> She reminded me that diets, meal plans and  <br>
even workouts had never made any difference. She needed to know for sure how these powerful  
substances would help her.  

<t ms=85>30:32</t> I decided to show her the ingredients in the  <br>
tonic and the rock solid proof behind them that Dr. Tamaki had sent me then she could  
decide for herself.  

<t ms=95>30:41</t> This first ingredient is the Japanese holy  <br>
grail of fat loss and is said to be why so many people in Japan are in great shape without  
diet or exercise.  

<t ms=44>30:51</t> It's called egcg and it's a plant compound  <br>
found in green and white tea. studies on humans show that egcg is linked to a reduction in  
body fat and is a potent stimulator of thermogenesis,  

<t ms=38>31:04</t> the biochemical process which causes fat in  <br>
the body to be burned as energy. Researchers found that by stimulating thermogenesis  
egcg can help burn extra calories and stave  

<t ms=98>31:15</t> off fat. In other words, it converts more of your fat  <br>
to energy.  

<t ms=93>31:20</t> What's more green tea is linked to skin cell  <br>
rejuvenation, according to the Medical College of Georgia.  

<t ms=03>31:27</t> And if you enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, that's  <br>
great news because egcg burns fat even faster with caffeine.  

<t ms=22>31:34</t> The second powerful ingredient is pepper in  <br>
a potent antioxidant extracted from black pepper, pepper and has traditionally been  
used for centuries in Asia to assist troublesome  

<t ms=65>31:44</t> digestion. But researchers from Sage Zhong University  <br>
in South Korea found that paper and blocks  

<t ms=6>31:49</t> the formation of fat cells and supports healthy  <br>
blood sugar metabolism. This means paper and works to prevent fat  
storage after a meal, which is why it helps  

<t ms=71>31:58</t> keep you slim and toned once you've lost excess  <br>
weight. The next powerful ingredient is an exotic  
fiber named inulin.  

<t ms=61>32:06</t> inulin is extracted from the chicory plant  <br>
root, and there's some amazing evidence behind it.  

<t ms=3>32:12</t> In one study, volunteers who simply added  <br>
inulin to their diet lost significantly more weight than those who didn't.  

<t ms=54>32:19</t> That's because inulin directly targets visceral  <br>
fat. visceral fat is the most dangerous type of  
deep fat which sticks to your organs and puts  

<t ms=16>32:28</t> you at higher risk of many modern deadly conditions. The Imperial College of London a reputable  <br>
School, which is like the Harvard of England  

<t ms=85>32:35</t> found something super interesting when they  <br>
studied it. The researchers found that adding insulin  
to your diet could switch off cravings for  

<t ms=29>32:43</t> high calorie foods in the brain and added  <br>
that inulin is an effective tool to significantly improve weight loss.  

<t ms=01>32:51</t> Susan felt excited when she imagined how great  <br>
it would be to instantly turn off her own cravings.  

<t ms=8>32:56</t> It'd be perfect for when she felt those strong  <br>
desires to eat too many cookies or binge on doughnuts it would make her weight loss journey  
so much easier.  

<t ms=45>33:05</t> What's more inulin is also a type of prebiotic  <br>
which means it supports healthy digestion. In other words, it can reduce digestive discomforts  
and bloating.  

<t ms=01>33:15</t> It also tastes delicious, which is why it's  <br>
definitely something you should be adding to your breakfast each morning.  

<t ms=75>33:20</t> The next ingredient is a beautiful red flower  <br>
that Okinawans drink as herbal tea. It's called the hibiscus sabdariffa and its  
name means delicate flower.  

<t ms=64>33:30</t> In one study on the hibiscus flower by the  <br>
Institute of Medicine of Taiwan 36 overweight participants took either hibiscus extract  
or a placebo.  

<t ms=2>33:40</t> After 12 weeks, those taking hibiscus extract  <br>
had reduced body weight, body fat body mass index and hip to waist ratio.  

<t ms=18>33:49</t> These participants did nothing different to  <br>
the others apart from take hibiscus and the fat just fell off their bodies.  

<t ms=32>33:56</t> So to recap the four metabolic ingredients  <br>
Okinawa tonic contains our egcg which burns your stored fat as energy heparin, which prevents  
fat storage and blocks fat cell formation  

<t ms=819>34:09</t> in Ulan which switches up the cravings in  <br>
your brain and supports digestive health and a wonderful hibiscus flower that accelerates  
the overall fat loss effect.  

<t ms=95>34:19</t> These ingredients alone would be enough for  <br>
you to rewind the clock and get the slim toned and youthful body of your younger years back.  

<t ms=78>34:27</t> Yet the Okinawa tonic does even more because  <br>
it also includes a super healthy blend of antioxidant fruits and berries to support  
your energy immunity and digestion.  

<t ms=01>34:38</t> The first of those is aronia Berry aronia  <br>
is a powerful antioxidant that helps cool the fire of an inflamed digestive system supports  
immunity increases energy and is a great source  

<t ms=35>34:50</t> of fiber. A 2016 study found that aronia Berry support  <br>
healthy blood sugar levels and accelerates  

<t ms=08>34:57</t> weight loss in overweight individuals then  <br>
There's the Acai Berry, a purple fruit which you may have heard of.  

<t ms=99>35:03</t> This potent anthocyanin supports brain health  <br>
and maintains healthy cholesterol levels. But what may interest you is that it can also  
reduce fat absorption during mealtime.  

<t ms=43>35:14</t> Next, there's mulberry. mulberry helps maintain healthy blood sugar  <br>
and cholesterol markers that make a big difference  

<t ms=67>35:21</t> to your weight and overall health and mulberry  <br>
contains a substance called Rutan known for increasing levels of fat burning in the body,  
and the final antioxidant fruit is momordica  

<t ms=11>35:33</t> tarantia. This is a powerful nutrient extracted from  <br>
a tropical vine.  

<t ms=95>35:37</t> It's used as a cooking ingredient in Asia  <br>
and according to the Journal of medicinal food, it supports healthy blood sugar levels  
and has been shown to decrease fat in the  

<t ms=99>35:46</t> midsection. This antioxidant mix provides you with the  <br>
boost from its vitamins, digestive support,  

<t ms=3>35:53</t> and extra energy you need to feel great all  <br>
day. What's more, the fiber content in these berries  
helps you feel fuller for longer.  

<t ms=58>36:01</t> Now imagine combining the four powerful metabolic  <br>
ingredients together with the antioxidant berry mix and drinking it daily.  

<t ms=83>36:08</t> And you can see why Okinawans are the slimmest  <br>
healthiest and longest living community on the planet.  

<t ms=23>36:15</t> Susan felt much better after seeing that trusted  <br>
universities medical schools, doctors and scientists had all shown that these exact  
tonic ingredients would combine to boost her  

<t ms=39>36:25</t> metabolism, cut cravings and make her feel  <br>
young and sexy again. And it was true that Okinawa where this tonic  
came from was the healthiest place in the  

<t ms=791>36:34</t> entire world with the lowest rates of overweight  <br>
men and women. She decided to give it a go as she had nothing  
to lose and nothing else worked.  

<t ms=64>36:43</t> I wanted to get her started but I quickly  <br>
ran into a problem. I could find the ingredients from various  
suppliers around the world.  

<t ms=81>36:50</t> But they took weeks to be shipped. They were also pricey and set me back around  <br>
$350 for a month supply.  

<t ms=88>36:58</t> But when we figured out what Susan had spent  <br>
on the diets, gadgets, workouts and prepared meal plans over the years, it totaled around  
$11,600 and none of it even worked.  

<t ms=48>37:10</t> I decided that $350 was a small price to pay  <br>
for Susan to reclaim her youthful body appearance and energy.  

<t ms=45>37:18</t> After all, this potent tonic destroys fat  <br>
cells eliminates toxins from your body enhances energy sleep and supports brain power.  

<t ms=67>37:27</t> The ingredients arrived but I still need a  <br>
time to dry them out and grind them down into a powder form.  

<t ms=8>37:33</t> And finally, a few days later, I finally had  <br>
the Okinawa flat belly tonic right in front of me.  

<t ms=37>37:40</t> I mixed the powder with water to make the  <br>
tonic for Susan that same day. I was expecting some bitter, bad tasting brew  
that we need to hold our noses for, but it  

<t ms=4>37:49</t> tasted delicious, like a dessert drink. Now I have to admit, I'm usually the most  <br>
skeptical guy in the room.  

<t ms=97>37:56</t> And even if it had been scientifically proven  <br>
that this strange mix of natural ingredients melts off belly fat.  

<t ms=74>38:03</t> I was far from being convinced. But the very next day after drinking it for  <br>
the first time Susan texted me.  

<t ms=14>38:11</t> Hey, Mike, I've lost an inch from my waist,  <br>
she wrote, but I didn't want her getting her hopes too high.  

<t ms=73>38:17</t> So I stayed cool about it. That's fine, I replied.  <br>
<t ms=12>38:21</t> But a few days after that she called me excited. Hey, Mike, I've said four and a half pounds  <br>
Is this normal?  

<t ms=65>38:28</t> I wanted to get excited for her. But again, I had to hold back Susan had to  <br>
lose at least 35 or even 45 pounds, and we  

<t ms=98>38:36</t> were nowhere near that. Just keep doing what you're doing.  <br>
<t ms=53>38:40</t> I said taking a deep breath to stay calm. You have to know that even at this point,  <br>
I wasn't convinced.  

<t ms=57>38:47</t> See, I'm the kind of guy who has to see something  <br>
work before my eyes to actually believe it. Like so many people.  

<t ms=36>38:55</t> I was sick of the fad diets that gave people  <br>
so much hope only for them to be crushed with disappointment.  

<t ms=59>39:02</t> But I was about to see the proof when Susan  <br>
invited us around for a barbecue. It had been just a few weeks since she started  
drinking her daily tonic.  

<t ms=4>39:11</t> And when I opened the door I was not ready  <br>
for what I was about to see. The first thing I noticed was her face how  
it had become slimmer and she'd lost her double  

<t ms=99>39:20</t> chin. Then I looked down and saw the new slim a  <br>
yoga pants she was wearing her t shirt that  

<t ms=05>39:27</t> revealed her midriff. Her skin had firmed up.  <br>
<t ms=22>39:30</t> Her eyes looked brighter, and her voice sounded  <br>
so energetic, so happy. she'd lost 24 pounds and she looks stunning.  

<t ms=49>39:39</t> And most of all, she looks so young and vibrant. I could hardly believe it.  <br>
<t ms=3>39:44</t> She'd rewound the clock and transformed her  <br>
body and what just 22 days. Emotion overwhelms me and I choked my greetings  
out, tears welling up in my eyes.  

<t ms=44>39:56</t> Mark then appeared behind her now looking  <br>
leaner, stronger and more konfidence heat started taking the tonic just one week ago,  
and he couldn't keep his hands off his gorgeous  

<t ms=51>40:06</t> toned wife. Susan felt like she'd been in a dark room  <br>
for years and somebody had suddenly switched  

<t ms=66>40:12</t> on the light. The simple formula from the healthiest island  <br>
in the world had targeted the root cause of  

<t ms=63>40:18</t> her belly fat directly unlocking her powerful  <br>
natural ability to incinerate fat. I hadn't seen my sister so happy for years,  
I was astounded by the transformation in her  

<t ms=31>40:30</t> body. I was delighted that we'd been lucky enough  <br>
to stumble on it, especially as two weeks  

<t ms=51>40:36</t> later, she emailed me the results from her  <br>
blood tests, which showed her health was now as good as a woman.  

<t ms=49>40:42</t> 10 years younger than her age, she felt far  <br>
more confident walking down the street with their new slender body.  

<t ms=42>40:49</t> Her hair was shiny and fuller, and even her  <br>
nails were firmer. One day, she bumped into her cousin in the  
mall who didn't recognize her at first and  

<t ms=68>40:57</t> was stunned by her new attractive Look, she  <br>
was proud to notice her reflections in store windows and see the toned youthful body she  
had in her 20s back on display.  

<t ms=33>41:08</t> Once again, Susan melted away a total of 33  <br>
pounds during that short time, and another 21 pounds in the weeks that followed.  

<t ms=31>41:17</t> And even if her result blew me away, I still  <br>
wanted proof that this simple solution could help every kind of overweight person out there.  

<t ms=22>41:26</t> I mean, maybe we just got lucky. But then my solution was put to the test.  <br>
<t ms=46>41:32</t> Two weeks later, my cousin Joe came to stay. He's a craft beer fan who loves watching football  <br>
and was at least 50 pounds overweight.  

<t ms=369>41:41</t> And when Joe saw Susan's incredible transformation  <br>
he wanted in so I got the ingredients together and mixed up a jar for Joe.  

<t ms=42>41:50</t> Of course, Joe didn't give up his craft beer,  <br>
or even his favorite mac and cheese that he enjoyed every Friday.  

<t ms=95>41:56</t> But he ended up destroying his belly fat even  <br>
faster than Susan. He texted me a photo later of a lean, younger  
looking dude, I was about to ask him why he  

<t ms=61>42:07</t> was sending me photos of other guys. When I realized it was actually him in the  <br>
photo.  

<t ms=869>42:13</t> he'd lost 40 pounds, and I could hardly recognize  <br>
him. I got rid of my gut even while guzzling beers  
at the bar five nights a week, he said in  

<t ms=02>42:23</t> his text. But what I didn't count on was that Joe being  <br>
a big mouth would go and tell everyone he  

<t ms=27>42:29</t> knew in his local bar and his craft beer social  <br>
media groups about the amazing fat loss solution he discovered very soon I started getting  
30 to 40 messages a day on Facebook from dozens  

<t ms=95>42:41</t> of other beer fans, men and women, people  <br>
of all ages, when they tried the tonic to the results were crazy, an average of 23 pounds  
weight loss.  

<t ms=76>42:52</t> My sister and Joe asked me if we could make  <br>
this solution available to more people. They knew hundreds who were interested and  
felt that it wouldn't be right if we didn't  

<t ms=74>43:01</t> share it with others who were struggling with  <br>
their weight. This sounded like a great idea, but I didn't  
know where to start.  

<t ms=65>43:08</t> As luck would have it. A buddy of mine put me in touch with Michael  <br>
de a nutritionist. with years of experience  

<t ms=79>43:14</t> of formulating potent formulas into daily  <br>
tonics. Michael had worked with a top brand health  
companies, athletes and even some TV stars  

<t ms=11>43:23</t> to get them in shape as fast as possible. He had the idea of making the Okinawa tonic  <br>
into a powder, you could add one simple scoop  

<t ms=03>43:31</t> to your drink in the mornings and you'd be  <br>
set burning off fat all day long. We thought this was a great idea.  

<t ms=25>43:38</t> He found us a cutting edge certified and FDA  <br>
approved state of the art manufacturer in the USA who would produce our very own Okinawa  
tonic so we could help 1000s of others get  

<t ms=37>43:49</t> the same mind blowing results Susan did they  <br>
set about making the tonic into powder form that could be added to water to mix up a delicious  
morning drink.  

<t ms=36>43:59</t> After a few months they succeeded in doing  <br>
what has never been done before. They produced the Okinawa flat belly tonic  
right here in the USA.  

<t ms=04>44:09</t> The initial test they did with a tonic got  <br>
stunning results with women and men melting off fat faster than they'd ever seen and without  
making any changes to their diet or lifestyle.  

<t ms=91>44:20</t> But Michael and his team of doctors wanted  <br>
to make the tonic even more powerful before finally releasing it to the public.  

<t ms=65>44:27</t> So they added a super bonus blend to increase  <br>
its potency and add even more benefits for every type of woman or man struggling with  
their weight and health.  

<t ms=88>44:36</t> The first bonus nutrient is an unusual energy  <br>
boosting mineral blend from the mountains of Asia called Sheila Jeet.  

<t ms=15>44:44</t> Sheila Jeet has been used for centuries and  <br>
Ayurvedic medicine as a rejuvenating tonic because it contains 85 minerals.  

<t ms=32>44:52</t> Researchers believe that she legit helps move  <br>
minerals and other nutrients into the tissues that need them increasing energy and protecting  
you from stress.
