<t ms=44>00:03</t> welcome back with the Sand Pond Saga  <br>
<t ms=22>00:08</t> let's get started oh  <br>
<t ms=599>00:12</t> toad is asleep the bird could do the video instead  <br>
<t ms=199>00:18</t> welcome back to the Sand Pond song that what's wrong bird  <br>
<t ms=279>00:26</t> you don't want to do the video that's okay  <br>
<t ms=779>00:30</t> let's find someone else instead [Music]  <br>
<t ms=559>00:48</t> in these videos we use lots of complicated words  <br>
<t ms=8>00:54</t> but in this video let's set the record straight  <br>
<t ms=079>01:00</t> and Define what they mean welcome back to the Sand Pond Saga  <br>
<t ms=52>01:08</t> let's get started first let's define what a programming  <br>
<t ms=72>01:15</t> language is I speak English UK Edition unfortunately  <br>
<t ms=42>01:23</t> my computer does not but it does speak a bunch of programming languages that I  <br>
<t ms=479>01:30</t> also speak like HTML which I used to make this  <br>
<t ms=56>01:37</t> little game you have to catch all the birds put them  <br>
<t ms=6>01:42</t> in a cage and when you've done that you get a little Victory screen  <br>
<t ms=94>01:47</t> [Music] okay I didn't just use HTML that  <br>
<t ms=28>01:53</t> wouldn't work I used another programming language too called CSS to tell the  <br>
<t ms=119>02:00</t> computer what to do  <br>
<t ms=2>02:04</t> sorry to interrupt I'm editing the video right now and I've just realized that  <br>
<t ms=78>02:09</t> HTML is not a real programming language it's actually a markup language so when  <br>
<t ms=94>02:17</t> you use it you're not actually programming  <br>
<t ms=44>02:21</t> your markuping instead so a better example  <br>
<t ms=379>02:31</t> like Microsoft PowerPoint let's define what a cellular automata is  <br>
<t ms=68>02:37</t> a cellular automata is where you have cells and you have rules the rules tell  <br>
<t ms=26>02:46</t> the cells what to do sandlab is a new cellular automata that  <br>
<t ms=519>02:53</t> I made cells follow rules to split merge and  <br>
<t ms=28>02:59</t> change color to simulate different elements  <br>
<t ms=319>03:04</t> sorry to interrupt again I'm editing the video and I've just found out that  <br>
<t ms=22>03:08</t> sandlab is not actually a cellular automata it's an agent-based Model A  <br>
<t ms=2>03:13</t> Better example would be something deterministic and fixed like Tetris  <br>
<t ms=3>03:18</t> sorry to interrupt again but I've just found out that Tetris is also not a  <br>
<t ms=099>03:23</t> cellular automata it's a cellular automaton a better example would be  <br>
<t ms=44>03:28</t> Tetris multiplayer because it has multiple Cellular automatons in it sorry  <br>
<t ms=44>03:34</t> to interrupt again but I'm realizing that these interruptions are making the  <br>
<t ms=78>03:39</t> video take too long so to speed things up I've decided to do the next two  <br>
<t ms=659>03:45</t> sections at the same time let's define light intelligence intelligence is  <br>
<t ms=9>03:54</t> [Music] intelligence engine  <br>
<t ms=72>04:06</t> timing fish can swim swim forwards and turn up  <br>
<t ms=239>04:12</t> and down they grow when they eat a circle and shrink when they eat a square  <br>
<t ms=44>04:18</t> when they get big enough they speak into two causing everything about them to  <br>
<t ms=08>04:25</t> mutate including their brains which control their inner helping behaviors  <br>
<t ms=8>04:33</t> stories that these fish are not an example of  <br>
<t ms=4>04:41</t> intelligence they're actually artificial lines  <br>
<t ms=639>04:46</t> drawings I'm editing I'm editing the video right  <br>
<t ms=84>04:51</t> now and I've just found out that they're not artificial intelligence either  <br>
<t ms=979>04:55</t> because there's no way of telling her if they have a Consciousness  <br>
<t ms=1>05:01</t> official intelligence let's Define fractal  <br>
<t ms=44>05:07</t> a fractal is a pattern with infinite detail  <br>
<t ms=479>05:12</t> no matter how far you zoom in there's always more to discover  <br>
<t ms=52>05:19</t> an example of a fractal is a fractal because no matter how far you zoom in no  <br>
<t ms=66>05:27</t> matter how much you break it down no matter how long you do this for  <br>
<t ms=259>05:34</t> sorry to interrupt I'm editing the video right now and I've just realized that a  <br>
<t ms=339>05:39</t> fractal is not a fractal actually a fractal so a better example  <br>
<t ms=18>05:45</t> of a fractal would be a fractal  <br>
<t ms=96>05:48</t> sorry to interrupt again but I've just realized that a fractal is not a fractal  <br>
<t ms=56>05:55</t> it's actually a fractal a better example of a fractal would be a fractal  <br>
<t ms=78>06:03</t> sorry to interrupt again I've just realized that a fractal well it's not  <br>
<t ms=46>06:08</t> actually a fractal because if you break it down fully sorry to interrupt it's  <br>
<t ms=72>06:12</t> actually just realized that a fact because it's not looking at all these  <br>
<t ms=32>06:16</t> things let's Define art  <br>
<t ms=6>06:39</t> art is a tool that we use to express ourselves and communicate  <br>
<t ms=419>06:47</t> sometimes the art is for other people and sometimes it's just for you  <br>
<t ms=8>06:54</t> the art that you make tells us something about you  <br>
<t ms=5>07:00</t> personally I like to play Little Tunes on the baritone ukulele  <br>
<t ms=419>07:08</t> it's not meant to be heard by anyone but it helps me to express how I'm feeling  <br>
<t ms=84>07:14</t> and I find it quite fun [Music]  <br>
<t ms=94>07:22</t> so to interrupt I'm editing the video right now and I've just realized that  <br>
<t ms=08>07:28</t> playing the ukulele is not art it's actually just annoying the neighbors a  <br>
<t ms=259>07:34</t> real example of art is a i art so I asked GPT to make some prompts for  <br>
<t ms=28>07:41</t> me which I gave to darlie and turned into an nft I put it on open C and sold  <br>
<t ms=74>07:46</t> it for lots of money now that's real art  <br>
<t ms=473>07:53</t> Define a definition is a tool that we use to  <br>
<t ms=3>08:00</t> express ourselves and communicate sometimes the definition is for other  <br>
<t ms=419>08:06</t> people and sometimes it's just for you the definition that you use tells us  <br>
<t ms=78>08:12</t> something about you personally I like to use definitions  <br>
<t ms=3>08:18</t> very Loosely but what about you what definitions do  <br>
<t ms=62>08:25</t> you use [Music]<br>
